# Power-Consumption-Forecasting
## Context
Forecasting hourly power consumption using data is beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows power companies to plan and optimize their electricity generation and distribution resources more efficiently, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply. Secondly, it helps in managing peak demand periods by identifying potential spikes in power consumption and implementing strategies to mitigate them. Thirdly, accurate forecasting enables better demand-response programs, where consumers can adjust their electricity usage based on predicted peak hours, leading to cost savings and reduced strain on the grid. Lastly, it aids in promoting energy conservation and sustainability by providing insights into consumption patterns and encouraging more efficient energy use.
